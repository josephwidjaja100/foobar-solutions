# foobar-solutions

Now that Google has sadly ended access to the foobar program, I think it is now okay to ofifically release all of my (sometimes painstaking) solutions to the very fun foobar problems!

Thank you Google for this amazing experience (some of the best/most fun coding days of my life)
